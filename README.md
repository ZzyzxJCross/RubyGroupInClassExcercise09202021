# Ruby Eco Simulation
This Repo is intended to facilitate our submission for the in-class exercise.

# Quickstart
We have prepared a special stakeholder link to view our code at the site Repl.it
This will require creating an account but it is a quick and easy process.

Alternatively from Repl.it you can install Ruby and run it through the command line in the terminal through the following instructions:
In order for the code to be run, Ruby will need to be installed on the computer that will run it.
You can install Ruby through the following site:

In order to run the Lexer, you need to first have the input.txt file in the same folder as lexerParser.rb
Once they are in the same folder, navigate to the folder they are in with the terminal and run the following command:
bundle exec ruby main.rb input.txt

In order to change the data it is using, navigate to input.txt and alter the contained information.
